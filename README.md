![Geomap Visualization of sweden](https://github.com/srikar0896/d3js/blob/master/Screenshot%20(83).png?raw=true)

This is the map of sweden and data is taken from http://www.gadm.org/country.Here you can download data of the map in all formats For the map visualization I've used shape file format and convert it to .geoJSON format with QGIS software.There are other ways too.Once you got the geojson file we can retrieve the data from that geojson file and use in d3 map visualization and on mouse over effect you can see state name on the left and the remaining states opacity decreases.
